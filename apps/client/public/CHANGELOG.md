# 2026-02-20

### 🩹 Fixes

- Fixed changing location on the admin page. It did not register any location change, even the existing one
- `PATCH /stations/$id` now deletes old location when it's orphaned (no stations at that location)
- `/stations`, `/admin/stations` and `/admin/locations` now properly refetches new data on each re-mount (after switching pages back and forth etc.)
- Notes field on each cell on `/submission` is now properly debounced which fixes lag while typing
- Only adding `notes` etc. on `/submission` is not a problem anymore since `unique` check on `submissions.proposed_cells` has been simplified from `submission_id`, `station_id`, `band_id`, `rat` to just `submission_id`, `target_cell_id`
- The table on `/stations`, `/admin/stations` & `/admin/locations` will no longer reset to page `1` when fetching more stations (after viewing ~80 records)
- Fixed showing XPIC radiolines in `tooltip`, `popup` & `dialog` (2 with diff polarization TX -> 2 RX)
- Fixed grouping FDD radiolines in the dialog
- Reject & Approve route of submissions now properly save old submission value(s)

### 🚀 Enhancements

- Map saves your zoom and lat,lng in local storage. The state persists between pages reloads, switching pages etc.
- LocationPicker (on `/submission` and `/admin/stations/$id`, `/admin/submissions/$id`, `/admin/locations/$id`) does not automatically fill data from Nominatim after creating new location
- Added ability to remove existing location on `/admin/locations/$id`
- Orphaned locations are now included for admins, editors & moderators in LocationPicker and `/admin/locations`
- Added more checks on `POST /submissions` regarding changed station & location
- Added support for NR Type (NSA, SA) everywhere

### 🏡 Chore

- Changes to existing components to satisfy React Compiler rules
- Removed `ml-1` from cellTable's cells count (station dialog)

# 2026-02-19

### 🩹 Fixes

- Made `gnBID` optional on `/submission` page
- Fixed checking the `existingLocation` on the server on submission submit
- Fixed sending `details` object in the cells on admin station edit page
- Fixed overlapping radiolines tooltip hovers by unmouting the container on `onMouseLeave`
- Fixed setting `operator` on admin station edit page

### 🚀 Enhancements

- Added ability to see new cells or permits in the last 30 days
- Added support for PCI in LTE
- Redesigned radiolines tooltip and popup
- Properly started to identify and group radiolines (XPIC, FDD, FDD 2+0)
- Added antenna height from `device-registry` in sectors
- Added a check for any changes on admin station edit page

### 🏡 Chore

- Made (tried to make) the `/uke/locations` route faster (or so I think...)
- Refactored some functions there and there
